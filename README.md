  <p><em>Bring AI agents into production in minutes with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore</em>
</div>

This repository contains hands-on labs demonstrating the capabilities of [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/what-is-bedrock-agentcore.html), an agentic platform to build, deploy and operate agents securely at scale - using any framework and model.

## What is Amazon Bedrock AgentCore?

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore enables developers to accelerate AI agents into production with enterprise-grade scale, reliability, and security. AgentCore provides composable services that work with popular open-source frameworks and any model, eliminating the choice between open-source flexibility and enterprise requirements.

## Prerequisites

Before starting any lab, ensure you have:
- [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/account/?trk=87c4c426-cddf-4799-a299-273337552ad8&sc_channel=el) with [appropriate permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/runtime-permissions.html)
- Python 3.10+ installed
- [AWS CLI configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- Basic understanding of [AI agents](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ai-agents/?trk=87c4c426-cddf-4799-a299-273337552ad8&sc_channel=el) and [AWS services](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/?trk=87c4c426-cddf-4799-a299-273337552ad8&sc_channel=el)

### Optional: Using uv for Python Project Management

For faster Python dependency management, consider using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) instead of traditional `pip` and `venv`:

```bash
# Install dependencies with uv (faster alternative to pip)
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or initialize projects with uv
uv init my-agent-project
```

This is optional - all labs work with standard `pip` commands as documented.
